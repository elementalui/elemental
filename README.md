# Elemental UI

React & CSS UI Framework.

Currently under development; built by [@JedWatson](https://github.com/JedWatson) and [@JossMac](https://github.com/JossMac) at [Thinkmill](http://www.thinkmill.com.au).

See [elemental-ui.com](http://elemental-ui.com) for examples and demos; docs coming soon!

## Browser Support

We'd like Elemental to be viable (functionally and aesthetically) to as many browsers as possible, without hindering our ability to move quickly.

For now that means:

- Chrome (mobile and desktop)
- Safari (mobile and desktop)
- Firefox
- Internet Explorer 9 and up
